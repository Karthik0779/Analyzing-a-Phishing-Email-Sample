   Email Header Analyzer - How to Use It

An Email Header Analyzer helps you identify the true source and path of a suspicious email by analyzing its metadata. This guide explains how to extract email headers and use free online tools to analyze them.

  ðŸ”Ž What Is an Email Header?

An email header contains technical details about the message, including:
- The senderâ€™s IP address
- The servers it passed through
- Authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- The actual sending domain (not just what appears in the inbox)

This information helps detect spoofing, phishing, and **fraudulent senders.

  Step 4: Understand the Results

Look for these signs:
- SPF / DKIM / DMARC: Should be "pass". "Fail" indicates spoofing.
- Sender IP Address: Confirm if it's from the expected domain.
- Received Path: Trace which servers the email passed through.
- Delays: Abnormal delays may indicate manipulation.



 If the Email Looks Suspicious

- Report it using your email providerâ€™s phishing report option.
- Block the sender.
- Do not click on links or download attachments.
- Inform your security team**, if you're in an organization.
