   What is Phishing and How Does It Work?

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers trick people into giving up sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers. It usually happens through fake emails, messages, or websites that appear to be from trusted sources.

It’s different from hacking — phishing is about fooling people, not breaking into systems.



    Why is it Called "Phishing"?

Just like fishing with bait, attackers "phish" for your personal data by pretending to be legitimate companies or people. One click on a fake link could lead to stolen money, lost data, or compromised accounts.
